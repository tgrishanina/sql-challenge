# Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

# Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the
tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBD.

# Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

# Data Analysis
1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
